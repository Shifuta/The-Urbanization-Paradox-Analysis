1. **Total Population and Growth Rate Plot:**
   - Created a data frame with years, total population, and growth rates.
   - Plotted the total population over the years with a blue line.
   - Added a second y-axis for growth rates in red, creating a dual-axis plot.
   - Dynamically adjusted the y-axis limits for growth rates.
   - Saved the plot as "population_and_growth.png."

```{r}

# Create a data frame with the given data
data <- data.frame(
  Year = c(1901, 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, 2011, 2021),
  Population = c(28.93, 31.56, 33.25, 53.56, 42.00, 44.17, 55.22, 76.40, 89.91, 111.46, 130.03, 149.13, 171.18),
  GrowthRate = c(NA, 0.87, 0.52, 0.68, 1.65, 0.50, 2.23, 2.50, 2.33, 2.15, 1.54, 1.34, 1.08)
)

# Plotting the Total Population
png("population_and_growth.png", width = 800, height = 600)  # Set width and height as per your preference
plot(data$Year, data$Population, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2, 
     xlab = "Year", ylab = "Population (in million)",
     main = "National Population and Growth Rate Over Time")

# Adding a second y-axis for Growth Rate
par(new = TRUE)
plot(data$Year, data$GrowthRate, type = "l", col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 2,
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "")

# Adjusting y-axis limits dynamically
max_population <- max(data$Population, na.rm = TRUE)
max_growth_rate <- max(data$GrowthRate, na.rm = TRUE)

axis(side = 4, at = pretty(seq(0, max_growth_rate, length.out = 6)))

# Adding legends
legend("topright", legend = c("Population", "Growth Rate"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1:2, lwd = 2)

dev.off()  # Close the PNG device



```


2. **Urban Population and Growth Rate Plot:**
   - Created a data frame for urban population and growth rates.
   - Plotted the urban population over the years with a green line.
   - Added a second y-axis for urban growth rates in orange, creating a dual-axis plot.
   - Dynamically adjusted the y-axis limits for urban growth rates.
   - Saved the plot as "urban_population_and_growth.png."

```{r}

# Create a data frame with the given data for Urban Population
urban_data <- data.frame(
  Year = c(1901, 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, 2011, 2021),
  UrbanPopulation = c(0.70, 0.81, 0.88, 1.07, 1.54, 1.82, 2.64, 6.27, 13.23, 20.87, 28.61, 43.31, 65.9),
  UrbanGrowthRate = c(NA, 1.39, 0.85, 2.00, 3.59, 1.69, 3.72, 6.66, 10.66, 4.56, 3.15, 3.37, 3.19)
)

# Plotting the Urban Population
png("urban_population_and_growth.png", width = 800, height = 600)
plot(urban_data$Year, urban_data$UrbanPopulation, type = "l", col = "green", lwd = 2, 
     xlab = "Year", ylab = "Urban Population (in million)",
     main = "Urban Population and Growth Rate Over Time")

# Adding a second y-axis for Urban Growth Rate
par(new = TRUE)
plot(urban_data$Year, urban_data$UrbanGrowthRate, type = "l", col = "orange", lty = 2, lwd = 2,
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "")

# Adjusting y-axis limits dynamically
max_urban_population <- max(urban_data$UrbanPopulation, na.rm = TRUE)
max_urban_growth_rate <- max(urban_data$UrbanGrowthRate, na.rm = TRUE)

axis(side = 4, at = pretty(seq(0, max_urban_growth_rate, length.out = 6)))

# Adding legends
legend("topright", legend = c("Urban Population", "Urban Growth Rate"), col = c("green", "orange"), lty = 1:2, lwd = 2)

dev.off()


```


3. **Combined Population and Growth Rate Plot:**
   - Combined data from both tables into a new data frame.
   - Plotted national population, urban population, national growth rate, and urban growth rate.
   - Used different colors and line styles for clarity.
   - Added legends to identify each line.
   - Saved the plot as "national_and_urban_population_and_growth.png."

```{r}

# Combining data from both tables
combined_data <- data.frame(
  Year = c(1901, 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, 2011, 2021),
  NationalPopulation = c(28.93, 31.56, 33.25, 53.56, 42.00, 44.17, 55.22, 76.40, 89.91, 111.46, 130.03, 149.13, 171.18),
  NationalGrowthRate = c(NA, 0.87, 0.52, 0.68, 1.65, 0.50, 2.23, 2.50, 2.33, 2.15, 1.54, 1.34, 1.08),
  UrbanPopulation = c(0.70, 0.81, 0.88, 1.07, 1.54, 1.82, 2.64, 6.27, 13.23, 20.87, 28.61, 43.31, 65.9),
  UrbanGrowthRate = c(NA, 1.39, 0.85, 2.00, 3.59, 1.69, 3.72, 6.66, 10.66, 4.56, 3.15, 3.37, 3.19)
)

# Plotting the National Population
png("national_and_urban_population_and_growth.png", width = 800, height = 600)
plot(combined_data$Year, combined_data$NationalPopulation, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2, 
     xlab = "Year", ylab = "Population (in million)",
     main = "National and Urban Population and Growth Rate Over Time")

# Adding lines for Urban Population
lines(combined_data$Year, combined_data$UrbanPopulation, type = "l", col = "green", lwd = 2)

# Adding a second y-axis for Growth Rates
par(new = TRUE)
plot(combined_data$Year, combined_data$NationalGrowthRate, type = "l", col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 2,
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "")
axis(side = 4, at = pretty(c(min(combined_data$NationalGrowthRate, na.rm = TRUE), max(combined_data$NationalGrowthRate, na.rm = TRUE))))

# Adding lines for Urban Growth Rate
lines(combined_data$Year, combined_data$UrbanGrowthRate, type = "l", col = "orange", lty = 2, lwd = 2)

# Adding legends
legend("topright", legend = c("National Population", "Urban Population", "National Growth Rate", "Urban Growth Rate"), 
       col = c("blue", "green", "red", "orange"), lty = 1:2, lwd = 2)

dev.off()


```


4. **Combined Population and Growth Rate Plot with Adjusted Size:**
   - Repeated the combined plot with adjusted size for better visibility.
   - Expanded the plot dimensions (width: 1600, height: 1200).
   - Modified the margin to accommodate a secondary y-axis for growth rates.
   - Saved the larger plot as "national_and_urban_population_and_growth2.png."
   
```{r}

# Plotting the National Population
png("national_and_urban_population_and_growth2.png", width = 1600, height = 1200)
par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 8))  # Adjusting the margin to make room for the secondary y-axis
plot(combined_data$Year, combined_data$NationalPopulation, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2, 
     xlab = "Year", ylab = "National Population (in million)",
     main = "National and Urban Population and Growth Rate Over Time")

# Adding lines for Urban Population
lines(combined_data$Year, combined_data$UrbanPopulation, type = "l", col = "green", lwd = 2)

# Adding a second y-axis for Growth Rates
par(new = TRUE)
plot(combined_data$Year, combined_data$NationalGrowthRate, type = "l", col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 2,
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "")
axis(side = 4, at = pretty(c(min(combined_data$NationalGrowthRate, na.rm = TRUE), max(combined_data$NationalGrowthRate, na.rm = TRUE))))

# Adding lines for Urban Growth Rate on the secondary y-axis
lines(combined_data$Year, combined_data$UrbanGrowthRate, type = "l", col = "orange", lty = 2, lwd = 2, yaxt = "n")
axis(side = 4, at = pretty(c(min(combined_data$UrbanGrowthRate, na.rm = TRUE), max(combined_data$UrbanGrowthRate, na.rm = TRUE))), col = "orange", las = 2, labels = FALSE)

# Adding legends
legend("topright", legend = c("National Population", "Urban Population", "National Growth Rate", "Urban Growth Rate"), 
       col = c("blue", "green", "red", "orange"), lty = 1:2, lwd = 2)

dev.off()


```




5. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Created data frames for national and urban population along with growth rates.
   - Merged the data frames based on the "Year" column.
   - Provided summary statistics, including min, max, mean, and quartiles.
   - Calculated the correlation matrix for population and growth rate variables.
   - Conducted linear regression analysis for national and urban population against the year, and for growth rates against the year.


```{r}

# Creating data frames for National and Urban Population
national_data <- data.frame(
  Year = c(1901, 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, 2011, 2021),

  NationalGrowthRate = c(NA, 0.87, 0.52, 0.68, 1.65, 0.50, 2.23, 2.50, 2.33, 2.15, 1.54, 1.34, 1.08)
)

urban_data <- data.frame(
  Year = c(1901, 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, 2011, 2021),
  UrbanPopulation = c(0.70, 0.81, 0.88, 1.07, 1.54, 1.82, 2.64, 6.27, 13.23, 20.87, 28.61, 43.31, 65.9),
  UrbanGrowthRate = c(NA, 1.39, 0.85, 2.00, 3.59, 1.69, 3.72, 6.66, 10.66, 4.56, 3.15, 3.37, 3.19)
)

# Merging the two data frames
combined_data <- merge(national_data, urban_data, by = "Year")

# Summary statistics
summary(combined_data)

# Correlation matrix
cor(combined_data[, c("NationalPopulation", "UrbanPopulation", "NationalGrowthRate", "UrbanGrowthRate")], use = "complete.obs")

# Linear regression - National Population vs. Year
national_lm <- lm(NationalPopulation ~ Year, data = combined_data)
summary(national_lm)

# Linear regression - Urban Population vs. Year
urban_lm <- lm(UrbanPopulation ~ Year, data = combined_data)
summary(urban_lm)

# Linear regression - National Growth Rate vs. Year
national_growth_lm <- lm(NationalGrowthRate ~ Year, data = combined_data)
summary(national_growth_lm)

# Linear regression - Urban Growth Rate vs. Year
urban_growth_lm <- lm(UrbanGrowthRate ~ Year, data = combined_data)
summary(urban_growth_lm)
